# Quiz Race

Quiz Race is an original game where players will try to reach a final goal answering generic trivia questions.

Every turn players will "bet" a number of steps (1-5). They can then answer a random question and if the answer is correct they move forward otherwise they move backwards.

Some special tiles will not make you go backwards if your answer is wrong.

Each tile is related to a category of questions.
